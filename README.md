**Goa Police Hackathon 2025 â€“ AI-Powered CCTV & Digital Media Forensic Analysis Tool**

ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution

We propose an AI-driven forensic toolkit that combines computer vision and digital integrity checks into one.
Core Capabilities:

1. CCTV Analysis
2. Automatic detection and tracking of people and vehicles.
3. Time-stamped appearance logs linked to unique IDs.
4. Matching against offender databases with high accuracy.
5. Forensic Media Analysis
6. Extraction of metadata (timestamps, GPS, device info, editing history).
7. File integrity verification through cryptographic hashing.
8. Tamper detection with clear anomaly flags.
9. Investigator Dashboard & Reporting
10. Searchable interface to review detections and evidence.
11. Tamper-proof forensic PDF reports containing hashes, logs, and detection snapshots.
12. Built-in audit trail to preserve chain of custody.

Expected Outcomes:

â€¢ A reliable, investigator-friendly platform that:
â€¢ Saves investigation time by automating video review.
â€¢ Enhances the credibility of digital evidence with forensic validation.
